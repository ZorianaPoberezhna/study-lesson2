A Python program terminates as soon as it encounters an error. In Python, an error can be a syntax error or an exception. In this tutorial, you’ll see what an exception is and how it differs from a syntax error. After that, you’ll learn about raising exceptions and making assertions. Then, you’ll get to know all the exception-related keywords that you can use in a try … except block to fine-tune how you can work with Python exceptions.
